# Jogo2048

This project was developed using extrictly Angular. It's my remake of 2048 game developed originally by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014.
I was addicted to it when I was studying engeneering! So, when I got to the end of a Angular course, I decided to chalenge myself with the goal of rebuilding it from scratch, without looking to the original code or it's reacreations.

My code has a lot of comments. They can help you to understand my thinking while developing this application. I hope it's not too much hehe

Below, a demonstration of how it works. You can access it at https://jogo2048-nathanlmsilva-gmailcom.vercel.app/ .
